<h2>📝 Plot 📝</h2>
Domas was once a powerful orc warrior, feared by all who knew him. But one fateful day, while exploring a cave deep in the mountains, he was attacked by a powerful demon who stole his limbs and left him helpless and trapped in the cave.

For years, Domas lay there, unable to move, unable to fight back. He watched as his once-great body withered away, his muscles atrophying and his spirit broken. But he never gave up hope. He knew that one day, he would find a way to get his limbs back and take revenge on the demon who had taken them from him.

One day, a group of wandering monsters stumbled upon Domas in the cave. They were amazed to see that he was still alive, despite his lack of limbs. They offered to help him, but Domas was hesitant. He had been betrayed before, and he was not sure if he could trust these strangers. But he saw something in their eyes, a glimmer of hope and determination, and he knew that they were the ones who could help him.

The wandering monsters offered to help Domas by giving him new limbs, each one taken from a different monster they had defeated in battle. The arms were strong and powerful, capable of crushing rocks and boulders, taken from a cyclops. The legs were nimble and quick, able to leap great distances and climb up steep cliffs, taken from a spider. With these new limbs, Domas was reborn, a warrior once again.

Domas ventured deeper into the cave, fighting off hordes of monsters and traps at every turn. He discovered secret passages and hidden treasures, and he grew stronger with each new limb he acquired.

Finally, he reached the demon's lair. It was a dark and foreboding place, filled with ancient magic and unspeakable horrors. But Domas was not afraid. He knew that he had come too far to turn back now.

With his new limbs, Domas battled the demon, using the unique abilities of each limb to outmaneuver and overpower his foe. The battle was long and grueling, but in the end, Domas emerged victorious. The demon lay defeated at his feet, and Domas reclaimed his stolen limbs.

The wandering monsters cheered and celebrated with Domas, but he knew that his journey was not over. There were other demons out there, other monsters to fight and conquer. But with his new limbs, he was ready for anything. He set out into the world, a green orc like monster with a heart full of courage and a body full of power, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
